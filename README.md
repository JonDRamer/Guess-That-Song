### Technologies used:

###### Javascript
###### AJAX
###### jQuery
###### HTML
###### CSS

### Description

###### This was the first web app I ever made.  It's a song guessing game. The app utilizes AJAX to make a request for a random song from the iTunes api and plays a preview. The user guesses the song name and if they get it correct they get a point.

### Key Takeaways

###### This was my first time using AJAX so I learned a lot about asynchronisity and promises.

###### I learned a lot more about how jQuery event triggers work. This was also my first time using jQuery in a web application.
